This program uses the node backend to run, so you need to download node before running, and set the corresponding environment variables. These libraries need to be installed before running:

    npm install mysql path base64-stream fs http formidable express cors body-parser express-session ejs multer captcha-slider

Please note that this list may not be complete, and there may be additional libraries mentioned in the error report in the terminal. Use `npm install [library]` to install any missing libraries.
